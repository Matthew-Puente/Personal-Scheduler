# PSS
The PSS is a task scheduler that takes in user inputted events and schedules them on a calendar. This calendar will tell the user if there are time and date conflicts between events.
You can schedule both recurring and single time events, as well as remove the events.
The Calendar can be saved onto a seperate file which can be loaded in so that event may be saved over multiple instances of using the program.
